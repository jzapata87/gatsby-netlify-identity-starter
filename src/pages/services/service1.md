The term bookkeeping means different things to different people.

- Many believe that bookkeeping is the same as accounting.  They assume that keeping a company's books and preparing its financial statements and tax reports are all part of bookkeeping, while others see bookkeeping as limited to recording transactions in journals or dayboooks and then posting the amounts in accounts in ledgers.

- Larger entities may have their own bookkeeping departments, whereby their bookkeeping is done in-house as transactions occur.  The results of those transactions can then be used, to either prepare a tax return or provide the financial information for the conduct of an independent audit, review or compilation by a CPA.  **That is accounting**.


Our firm provides **after the fact bookkeeping services** for a variety of clients, including attorneys, doctors, construction companies, realty companies, just to name a few, using **Quick Books Pro**.  There is no entity too small or large to whom we cannot provide bookkeeping services.

Those services include:
- the posting of transactions utilizing the client's bank records
- preparation of payroll reports, such as Federal Employee's Quarterly Reports (941s), Annual Federal Unemployment Tax Return (940), Texas Workforce Commission Reports & annual W-2s & 1099's, if applicable.

Utilizing the information provided & posted, we can provide compiled or reviewed financial statements, either on a monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual basis.
