In general, an audit is an investigation of an existing system, report, or entity. There are a number of types of audits that can be conducted, including the following.

- Compliance audit. This is an examination of the policies and procedures of an entity or department, to see if it is in compliance with internal or regulatory standards. This audit is most commonly used in regulated industries or educational institutions.
- Financial audit.  This is an analysis of the fairness of the information contained within an entity's financial statements. It is conducted by a CPA firm, which is independent of the entity under review. This is the most commonly conducted type of audit.
- A single audit is an examination of an organization that spends at least $750,000 of federal grants and awards per year. The audit is intended to provide assurance to the government that its funds are being expended appropriately. The audit is conducted by a certified public accountant, and the resulting compliance report is submitted to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse. Entities that typically undergo single audits are cities, states, nonprofit organizations, and universities. A single audit is also known as an OMB A-133 audit.
